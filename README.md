Income Prediction App - README
Welcome to the Income Prediction App! This application was created to help users estimate their average total income based on a variety of personal inputs. In this README, we'll take you through what we've already accomplished and explain the different components of the project.

Overview
The Income Prediction App is built using the Dash framework, a Python library for creating interactive web applications. Our app employs a pre-trained machine learning model, specifically a decision tree model, to provide accurate income estimates. Users simply need to input their details, and the app takes care of the rest!

Input Details: On the app's interface, you'll find a form where you can enter various personal details such as:

Gender
Education Level
Country
Ethnicity
Occupation
Age
Years of Experience
Get Predictions: Click the "Submit" button, and our app will take your inputs, process them through the pre-trained decision tree model, and provide you with a predicted average total income.

Start Fresh: If you need to reset the form and start over, simply click the "Reset" button.

Dependencies
Our app relies on several key Python libraries:

Dash: This forms the foundation of our interactive web interface.
pandas: We've used pandas to manage and manipulate data effectively.
plotly: This library helps us create dynamic and interactive visualizations.
scikit-learn (sklearn): Our machine learning model comes from scikit-learn, a powerful library for machine learning.
numpy: We've utilized numpy for numerical operations in our code.
Make sure these libraries are installed in your Python environment before running the app.
